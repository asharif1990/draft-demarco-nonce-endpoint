      "body": "- [ ] The proposed solution assumes that the interaction starts with the client interacting with the server without a nonce. As a result, an error code is returned with the nonce endpoint details and the client is then expected to interact with the nonce endpoint, obtain a new nonce, and then retry the request with the nonce.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The document should describe a flow that would allow the client to initially go directly to the nonce endpoint to obtain a nonce before contacting the server, to avoid the error case.\r\n\r\n- [ ] the document should describe a flow that would allow a valid response to a request with a valid nonce to return a new nonce that could be used with subsequent requests to avoid the need for a new request to the nonce endpoint, as an optimization to reduce latency in load situations.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The document should also add this new endpoint to the \"OAuth Authorization Server Metadata\" registry.",
